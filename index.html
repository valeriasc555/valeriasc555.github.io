             <p class="text">The Roman Empire was one of the largest and most influential empires in history. It began as a small city-state and evolved into a powerful empire that dominated much of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East for over a millennium.
             Founding of Rome (753 BCE): According to legend, Rome was founded by Romulus and Remus in 753 BCE. Over the centuries, it grew from a monarchy to a republic, with a complex political system involving elected officials and the Senate.</p>
